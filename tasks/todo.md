## Backlog (Future)

- [ ] **Structured Logging System** — Add Pino for structured JSON logging across API routes. Wire up Vercel log drain to Axiom or Datadog. Trigger: when adding auth, customer portal, or multiple API routes. Not needed while the site is static + one contact form.
- [ ] **Site Chatbot (Phase 2)** — Add an AI chatbot to assist visitors with common questions about Sovereign RCM. Prerequisite: all core Sovereign RCM pages built out (overview, how-it-works, pricing, pilot program) and 5-10 blog posts published for the bot to reference. Should complement the contact form, not replace it. Evaluate hosting, API costs, and integration approach when ready.
