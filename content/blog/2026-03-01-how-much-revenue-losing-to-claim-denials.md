A colleague of mine runs a five-provider orthopedics group outside Philadelphia. Good surgeons, packed schedule, strong patient reviews. When I asked him last fall what his denial rate was, he guessed around 5%.

The actual number was closer to 13%. He had no idea.

Most practice owners don't. Denials show up as line items buried in an RCM report that someone in billing reads and nobody else does. The billing team handles the rework. Some claims get recovered. A lot don't. And the practice keeps running, never quite seeing the full picture of what it's leaving on the table every month.

I wanted to write about this because I've lived it. I've coded and billed from the bedside in some of the highest-volume emergency departments in the country. I've written notes I know support a Level 5 visit, watched the claim get downcoded by a payer algorithm, and then spent time I didn't have fighting the appeal. The denial problem isn't abstract to me. It's a Tuesday.

## The Denial Rate Keeps Climbing

Kodiak Solutions tracks denial data across 2,100 hospitals and 300,000 physicians. Their 2024 numbers put the initial denial rate at 11.8%, up from 10.2% in 2020. That's a 15.7% increase in four years.

Experian Health's 2025 State of Claims survey tells the same story from a different angle: 41% of providers now report denial rates above 10%. Three years ago, that number was 30%. And 54% of providers say submitting clean claims is harder than it was a year ago.

MGMA's polling backs it up too. In a March 2024 survey, 60% of medical group leaders said their denial rates had increased compared to the previous year.

These aren't cherry-picked numbers from struggling systems. This is the landscape. If your practice runs below 8%, you're outperforming most of the industry. If you're at 12% or higher, you're not alone. But you're losing money you could be keeping.

## Where the Money Actually Goes

A denied claim isn't just a delayed payment. For a surprising number of practices, it's a permanent write-off.

The most underappreciated number in revenue cycle management: up to 65% of denied claims are never resubmitted. AHIMA has published this range, and every revenue cycle consultant I've talked to confirms it tracks with what they see. The claim gets denied, it goes into a queue, the queue gets long, the billing team triages, and the lower-dollar or more complex denials fall off the list. Nobody decides to abandon them. They just never make it back to the top.

The ones that do get reworked aren't free to process either. Premier Inc. found the average cost to rework a single denial jumped to $57.23 in 2023, up from $43.84 the year before. That's a 31% increase in a single year. And each denied claim goes through an average of three rounds of review, each taking 45 to 60 days. That's months of staff time tied up chasing money the practice already earned.

What makes this even harder to stomach: 90% of denials are preventable. The Advisory Board published that figure, and it's held up across the industry. Most denials trace back to eligibility issues, missing information, coding errors, or authorization gaps that could have been caught before submission. We're spending billions to fix problems that didn't need to exist.

## Running the Numbers

Let me make this concrete. Take a five-provider practice collecting $7.5 million a year in gross charges.

At a 10% denial rate, that's $750,000 in claims hitting a wall on first submission. If 65% of those never get resubmitted (the industry average), that's $487,500 written off permanently. Of the remaining $262,500 that gets reworked, roughly half gets recovered through appeals. That's $131,250 back in the door.

![Annual denial cost cascade for a five-provider practice](/blog/denial-cost-cascade.svg)

Total revenue lost: about $619,000 a year. Add roughly $43,000 in administrative rework costs (750 denied claims at $57 each), and the real annual impact lands somewhere north of $660,000.

That's close to 9% of gross revenue disappearing into a problem that is, by every measure, mostly preventable.

A practice running at 5% instead of 10% recovers roughly $300,000 a year. That funds a clinical hire, new equipment, or simply better margins. The gap between "average" and "good" in denial management is a six-figure number for most multi-provider practices.

## What I See from the Emergency Department

I'm an EM physician, so I see the worst version of this up close.

Emergency medicine has a unique problem: EMTALA requires us to treat every patient who walks through the door regardless of insurance status. We don't get to verify eligibility before we intubate someone. We don't get prior auth before we reduce a dislocated shoulder at 2 AM. We treat first and deal with the billing afterward.

Payers know this. And increasingly, they take advantage of it.

The most common tactic I see is retrospective downcoding. A patient comes in with chest pain. I work them up the right way: EKG, troponin, chest X-ray, risk stratification, shared decision-making about disposition. I document a Level 5 E/M visit because that's what it was. The insurer runs it through an algorithm, sees the final diagnosis was "non-cardiac chest pain," and downcodes it to a Level 3.

The documentation supports the higher code. They deny it anyway.

The AMA has documented this pattern. Payers are using automated software to downcode E/M levels without reviewing clinical records, basing the decision on final diagnosis rather than the complexity of the encounter. That's not how E/M coding works. But the practice has to file an appeal to prove it, and that appeal takes time and staff that small groups don't have.

Emergency physicians are also getting squeezed by the No Surprises Act. EDPMA's 2024 member survey found a 39% reduction in out-of-network reimbursement since the law took effect. When providers do win in the Independent Dispute Resolution process (and they win about 80% of the time), 59% of those rulings aren't paid within the required 30-day window. Over a quarter are underpaid even after the ruling.

And then there's the prior authorization burden. It hits every specialty, not just EM. The AMA's December 2024 survey of 1,000 physicians found that the average practice completes 39 prior authorizations per week, consuming about 13 hours of combined physician and staff time. Ninety-three percent said prior auth delays access to necessary care. Forty percent of practices now have staff who do nothing but prior authorization work.

Here's what gets me: when physicians do appeal prior auth denials, 83% are overturned. The denials weren't clinically justified in the first place. They were friction, designed to slow things down and make a percentage of providers give up. And it works. Only 20% of physicians always appeal an adverse PA decision.

## Payers Are Automating Denials

If denial rates are climbing while the underlying rules haven't fundamentally changed, something else is driving the increase.

It's automation.

HFMA reports that 71% of health insurers now use AI for utilization management, including prior authorization and concurrent review. A 2024 Senate report found that some AI denial tools produce rejection rates up to 16 times higher than traditional human review. Cigna was sued for using an algorithm called PXDX to auto-deny claims without a physician ever looking at the medical record. UnitedHealthcare faces similar litigation over its AI-driven post-acute care denials.

The numbers tell the story. Between 2022 and 2023, care denials increased by 20% for commercial claims and nearly 56% for Medicare Advantage claims, according to AHA data. UnitedHealthcare's prior auth denial rate for post-acute care more than doubled in two years, going from 10.9% in 2020 to 22.7% in 2022.

California responded by passing the Physicians Make Decisions Act, which prohibits insurers from using AI as the sole basis for a denial. Other states are following. But legislation moves slowly, and the payer automation is already deployed at scale.

The math is straightforward for insurers: if an AI can deny 16 times more claims per hour than a human reviewer, and 65% of those denials are never appealed, the ROI is enormous. They're not worried about the 35% that fight back. They're profiting from the majority that doesn't.

You don't beat that with more staff. You beat it with better systems.

## What Actually Works

After years of watching this from both the clinical and operational side, I've landed on a few things that consistently move the needle.

Clean-claim rate is the single most important metric. If you catch errors, eligibility gaps, and coding mismatches before submission, the denial doesn't happen in the first place. Best-in-class practices run above 95%. Most hover around 88-90%. Closing that gap is where the real money is.

Pre-submission scrubbing has to be payer-specific. A claim that passes CMS edits might still get denied by Aetna because Aetna has its own modifier rules for that procedure code. Generic scrubbing catches generic problems. The denials that slip through are the payer-specific ones, and keeping up with 15 to 20 different payer rule sets manually is a losing battle.

Denial analytics should drive prevention, not just recovery. If Blue Cross started rejecting a specific CPT/diagnosis combination six months ago and your team is still submitting those claims the same way, you have an intelligence problem, not a billing problem. You need pattern recognition happening before claims go out.

And documentation has to support coding at the point of care. Physicians write notes to communicate clinical thinking to other clinicians. Payers read those same notes looking for coding justification. Those are different audiences with different needs, and the gap between them is where undercoding and denials live.

This is exactly why we built [Sovereign RCM](/sovereign-rcm). It runs a multi-agent AI pipeline on a physical appliance inside your practice. No PHI leaves the building. The system reads clinical notes, identifies the right codes, applies payer-specific rules, and flags potential denial triggers before the claim goes out. Your billing staff reviews, approves, and submits. The AI handles the pattern recognition and payer logic that no human team can track across 20-plus insurance contracts.

If payers are using AI to deny claims faster, practices need AI to prevent denials faster. The alternative is continuing to lose six figures a year to a problem that keeps getting worse.
